"""
Bittensor Synapse definitions for SN98 ForeverMoney subnet.

The subnet uses a rebalance-only approach:
1. Validator queries miners with RebalanceQuery, asking miners for their suggestion how to deploy the inventory.
2. Miners decide how to deploy the inventory.

    Synapse for querying miners about rebalance decisions during backtesting.
